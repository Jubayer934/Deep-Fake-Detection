# 🧠 Detecting Deepfake using Hybrid Model

This project focuses on **detecting deepfake videos** using deep learning models — including a **CNN-based model (DFD_CNN)**, a **Hybrid Xception + Vision Transformer (Hybrid_XcepViT)** model, and an additional **ViT-only model** for comparison.

## ⚙️ Model Overview
### 🧱 DFD_CNN
A baseline **Convolutional Neural Network** designed to classify real and fake video frames.

### 🔗 Hybrid_XcepVit
A **hybrid model** combining:
- **Xception** network (for spatial feature extraction)
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** (for contextual and attention-based learning)

### 🔍 ViT Model
A separate **Vision Transformer-only** model was also trained to compare with the hybrid model’s performance.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Mount your dataset (folder containing extracted frames).  
3. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model.  

Example:
```python
!pip install tensorflow keras timm
